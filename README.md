## Underfloor Heating System with DHT11 Temperature Sensor Integration

### Project Overview

This project aims to create an intelligent underfloor heating system that dynamically adjusts the floor temperature based on real-time readings from a DHT11 temperature sensor. The system provides a comfortable and energy-efficient heating solution by adapting to the ambient temperature.

### Features

- **Dynamic Temperature Control:** The underfloor heating system utilizes data from the DHT11 temperature sensor to dynamically adjust the floor temperature. This ensures optimal comfort and energy efficiency.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The project includes real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing users to observe current temperature readings and system status.

- **User Configurable Settings:** Users can easily configure temperature thresholds and system behavior through a user-friendly interface.
